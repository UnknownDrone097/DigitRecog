# DigitRecog
Digit recognition neural network using the MNIST dataset, with support for batch and online descent.
The descent method is Nesterov.
No bugs have been observed.
This version has up to 90% accuracy (so far).
I am aware the NN class is extremely verbose, but it was coded this way as a means of making the obtuse math involved more explicit and easy to understand. I may come back to redo it later, but as it should have little to no effect on speed it is a low priority.
